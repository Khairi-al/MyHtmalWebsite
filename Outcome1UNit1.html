<h2>Describing The purpose of IT in modern business </h2>

<p>Businesses utilize IT in a number of different contexts and for many different purposes. In other words, IT isn’t just computers.<br>
   Such as, telephones, radio equipment and VOIP services used for vocal communications are included under the IT umbrella. <br>
   In the same way, peripherals such as printers, copiers, scanners and 3D printers are also considered part of a business’ IT systems.</p>
<p>Businesses use technology in a variety of different ways and  for different uses. IT does not just constitute of computers. <br>
   It also includes things such as printers, telephones, radio equipment, phone and communication also are included in the IT section. <br>
   3D printers, copiers, scanners, among other things, are also considered It infrastructure. </p>
<p>However, IT also includes the applications and executable programs that are installed on these devices to enable the user to complete <br>
   the task at hand. Somewhat less obviously, IT may also include the costs associated with purchasing, configuring and maintaining <br>
   the necessary hardware and equipment to keep the company’s IT systems operating smoothly. In these ways, IT has become critical to <br>
   the global business community.</p>
<p>Moreover, A strong IT system also helps all facets of a company work more productively. By enabling automation and digital tools, <br>
   tasks that once took hours can now be performed in a matter of minutes.Today’s agile businesses weave IT into everything they do, <br>
   enabling them to accomplish more in a shorter amount of time.
</p>
<h2>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.

</h2>
<p>A respectable management, a good plan, active team with good communication and IT knowledge, <br>
   available resources, update equipment and software, helps and needs to complete digital projects successfully.
</p>Therefore, demonstrate the project needs and feasibility, obtain project authorisation, by producing<br>
 a document confirming the needs for the project deliverables and describes, in broad terms. Outline the several <br>
 ways the project objectives can be come across. Conduct a comprehensive risk analysis: Include Technical, <br>
 Commercial, Environmental, Security and Safety. Estimate durations for activities and resources required. <br>
 “Resources of IT project will be all the equipment, networks, hardware, software, technical knowledge, <br>
 expertise and other resources, including all information technology resources and computer systems, held, <br>
 owned or used by any of the customers, the Target Companies or any of their respective Industries to the extent<br>
 used in connection with the Business as currently conducted and, in all material respects, as conducted during <br>
 the 12-month period prior to the date of this Agreement, or which are necessary for the provision of the Services<br>
 (as defined in the IT Transition Services Agreement)”.

<p> Moreover, the tools will be using the software for creating and development the project codes such as Python<br>
    or Java, Slack to make contacts easier among the project team, Trello to define role and responsibility <br>
    assignments and schedule team’s tasks and Draw.io or Microsoft Visio to draw the flowchart of the project. <br>
    All these resources and tools need high skills which are the abilities, knowledge and talents related to <br>
    the use, administration, development, design, architecture and management of technology.

</p>
<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT 

</h2>
<p>Determine the site's functionality. Everything the designer decide here will have an impact on the final website. <br>
    Does it need a storefront? Do it needs user comments? Will users need to create accounts? Is it article-oriented? <br>
    Image-oriented? All these questions and more will help inform the design and structure of the site. This can be <br>
    a drawn-out process, especially for larger companies with lots of people involved in the project.
</p>
Create a site map diagram. A site map diagram is like a flow chart and shows how users move from one page to the next.<br>
 You don't even need pages at this point, just a general flow of concepts. You can use a computer program to create <br>
 a diagram or sketch it out yourself on a piece of paper. Use the site map diagram to show how you envision the web <br>
 page hierarchy and connectivity. (Draw.io)
<p> 
 Try some card sorting. A popular method for a group is to use a stack fo cards to figure out everyone's ideal<br>
 approach. Take a stack of note cards and write the basic content of a single page on each one. Have your team <br>
 organize the cards in the way that they deem most useful. This is best for situations when you are collaborating <br>
 with others to create a site. (Trello)
</p>
<p>
        Use paper and a bulletin board, or a whiteboard. This is the original low-budget planning method and <br>
        allows you to quickly erase or move content and reroute it. Draw the design on pieces of paper and <br>
        connect them with string or draw the outline on a whiteboard. Great for brainstorming sessions. (Trello)
</p>
<p>
        Take a Content Inventory. Enter each of your pieces of content or existing pages into a spreadsheet. <br>
        Make notes as to the purpose of each one and use this list to determine what goes and what stays. <br>
        This will help cut the fat and simplify the redesign process.
</p>
<p>
        Make a wireframe to help solidify the hierarchy. An HTML wireframe is a skeleton of your future site, <br>
        using only the most basic tags and blocks to represent content. It answers the question, "What goes <br>
        on the screen and where?" Formatting and style are completely ignored in a wireframe. The wireframe <br>
        allows you to see content structure and flow before committing to style choices. HTML wireframes aren't static <br>
        like PDFs or images, and allow you to quickly move content blocks around to create a new structure.
</p>
<p>
        Create a style guide. This is essential for maintaining a cohesive style, especially for larger sites. <br>
        If the site is for a business that already has visual branding, this should be incorporated into the site <br>
        design. Things to potentially consider in a style guide: Navigation 
        Headers ( etc.)<br>
        Paragraphs<br>
        Italics<br>
        Bolding<br>
        Links (active, inactive, hovering)<br>
        Image use<br>
        Icons<br>
        Buttons<br>
        Lists<br>
        
</p>
<p>
        Apply your style. Once you've decided on a style and design for the site, it's time to start implementing it.<br>
        CSS is one of the easiest ways to implement style across a page or the entire site. 
</p>
<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
</h2>

<h3>
 Risk is a reality   
</h3>
<p>
As with most aspects of business, digital projects rarely happen under ideal circumstances. <br>
They can require a broad convergence of people, systems and data. Despite your best efforts, <br>
it’s not always possible to have ironclad answers to every question from the outset. And even <br>
if you do, things can change in a heartbeat.<br>
The most common reasons given for projects to fail were:<br>
Short term priorities taking over (51%). <br>
The initial scope was poorly defined (and the initial strategy / vision was unclear) (51% / 46%)<br>
Trying to do too much work all at once (50%).<br>
Silos between marketing and IT (39.5%)    
</p>
<p>
 Risk mitigation is the term used for having a plan to address risk in a project. All projects, <br>
 regardless of the size or nature of the project, should include risk mitigation during the planning <br>
 process. By investing time upfront to address risks head-on, you will be better prepared to turn <br>
 unexpected events into new opportunities, instead of spending your days putting out fires.</p>
<p>
First, by understanding the types of risks that exist.<br>
Known/Known (top left quadrant) – It was awarded of these during planning and understand what to do should they occur.<br>
Known/Unknown (top right quadrant) – It was aware of these during planning but aren’t fully prepared to respond to them.<br>
Unknown/Known (bottom left quadrant) – We are aren’t aware of these, but know how to handle them if they occur.<br>
Unknown/Unknown (bottom right quadrant) – We aren’t aware of these and don’t know how we would handle them.<br>    
</p>
<p>
        <!--img src="file:///C:/Users/user/Desktop/Frist-Project/risk.png" alt="Unknown/Known” width="500" height="333"-->
        <img src="file:///C:/Users/user/Desktop/Frist-Project/risk.png" width="500" height="333" alt="Unknown/Known” width">
</p>
<p>
A good digital project planning process will have the “Known/Known” risks built in. This means creating risk mitigation <br>
plans (Plan B) along with timing, and budget contingencies.
A good planning process will also address the “Known/Unknown” risks; <br>
first, by identifying potential prevention measures, and second, by developing mitigation plans should prevention <br>
efforts fail to be effective.
</p>
<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software 
</h2>
<p>
The first thing we should do it’s to understand the business needs of your client. its primary objective <br>
it’s to hit the market as fast as it can. So, the best choice could be an Ionic application: one codebase <br>
with an easy-to-learn framework in order to keep your velocity high enough. In other words, to choose <br>
a technology you need to know “why” your client needs the project, and not only “what” that project must do. <br>
“What” a project does isn’t just a bunch of user stories, but it’s to understand all the relations between <br>
the software and the people (not only the users) involved. But what about “how” to do it? we simply ask our <br>
client to order these four factors by importance.
</p>
<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen <br>
technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.
</h2>
<p>
 I used some of the technologies that helped me in different ways, <br>
 such as slack which made all team communication is in one place, <br>
 integration with services we already Use, all Content is Searchable <br>
 from one search box, files sharing, also with the supervisor, code <br>
 Snippets, one-to-one and private groups and accessible anywhere. <br>
 Draw.io is an open source technology stack for building diagramming <br>
 applications, and the world's most widely used browser-based end-user <br>
 diagramming application 
</p>
<p>
Moreover, we used Trello, it is a task management app that gives us <br>
a visual overview of what is being worked on and who is working on it. <br>
It used the Kanban system. It is best represented as a whiteboard filled <br>
with post-it notes. Each post-it represents different tasks involved in <br>
the project. Trello is a system of boards, lists and cards. This creates <br>
a system that allows for individuals or teams to track a project and <br>
collaborate or contribute where they can be most useful or where it is<br>
most needed.
</p>
<p>
Trello likes to keep things simple and only maintain one internal <br>
board, so there is only one place to keep track of things.
</p>
<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – <br>
How does GDPR impact digital projects?
</h2>
<p>
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), At its core, “GDPR is a new set of rules<br>
designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data. It aims to <br>
simplify the regulatory environment for business so both citizens and businesses <br>
in the European Union can fully benefit from the digital economy” 2. One of the <br>
major changes GDPR brings is providing consumers with a right to know when their <br>
data has been hacked. Organisations are required to notify the appropriate national <br>
bodies as soon as possible in order to ensure EU citizens can take appropriate <br>
measures to prevent their data from being abused. Consumers are also promised <br>
easier access to their own personal data in terms of how it is processed, with <br>
organisations required to detail how they use customer information in a clear <br>
and understandable way
