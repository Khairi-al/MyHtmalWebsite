    IT tools I used to complete the project there were THML, CSS to control project style
    And 8 visual studio files for each code main page (index), A bout me page, and page for each unit and outcomes. Therefore, I have needed also to use Trello to make cards for (things we need to do, doing, and done), draw.io (to draw flow diagram for web pages) and everything we looked-for, such as google, books and so on.
</p>    
    <p>
    2.2 the IT tools there were very useful and helpful to finish our project.
     
    this software is a phenomenal tool, gave me a good time to manage my work with a team on python and more on my website project, easy to use and organise the project of a whole team or just want to boost your own productivity.  It can use it in any area of the business, from software development and UX testing to marketing and design.
     
    Visual Studio includes a lot of flexible tools to build modern web applications and websites. Besides the Microsoft application development with ASP.NET, it can be use almost any other programming language, such as JavaScript, Node.js, Python, etc. Microsoft Visual Studio is an excellent rapid application development

<p>2.3 the project:
    strengths	weaknesses
    Videos background	Some page the buttons needs more 
    Semple	The sound of the videos dose not come out you cannot receive the music
    Happy 	
    Satisfied 	
    
    Happy because the first project I have did (webpage), for me it is life change a new career and direction 
    However, there are some points I am not happy with it, because I believe I can do better, and I will try my best do give myself chance to make more progress in this field    </p>
    <p>
    2.4 For this time, I think this is it, for making project like this one (webpage), further improvement I need to make this project better it is spending more time studying and searching online.
</p>

    2.5 the outcomes 
    1.	Strategy. Good website design is backed by strategy. 
    2.	Usability. Usability is all about the practical considerations of what goes into good website design, such as speed, user-friendliness, security, technical details like sitemaps, etc. ...
    3.	Style, nice figure, simple 
    4.	Content. Friendly 
    5.	Search Optimisation.
    6.	As much as I can
