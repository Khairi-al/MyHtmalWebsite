   <h2> 2.1 IT tools </h2>
   I used to complete the project there were THML, CSS to control project style And 9 visual studio files<br>
   for each code main page (index), A bout me page, and page for each unit and outcomes. Therefore, I have<br>
   needed also to use Trello to make cards for (things we need to do, doing, and done), draw.io (to draw flow <br>
   diagram for web pages) and everything we looked-for, such as google, books and so on.
</p>    
    <p>
   <h2>2.2 the IT tools there were very useful and helpful to finish our project.</h2>>
     this software is a phenomenal tool, gave me a good time to manage my work with a team on python and more on </h2>
     my website project, easy to use and organise the project of a whole team or just want to boost your own productivity.<br>
     It can use it in any area of the business, from software development and UX testing to marketing and design.
     Visual Studio includes a lot of flexible tools to build modern web applications and websites. Besides the Microsoft <br>
     application development with ASP.NET, it can be use almost any other programming language, such as JavaScript, Node.js, <br>
     Python, etc. Microsoft Visual Studio is an excellent rapid application development
