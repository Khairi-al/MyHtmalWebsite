      <p><h3>1.1 Layout for each page</h3>
            The main page (Index page)<br>
                       
            It has some information about me, video background, links to the other pages<br>
            
            Next page: linked with three pages with nice video and pictures background <br>
             
            Outcomes pages : these pages are excluding the information for this project<br>           
             
            Therefore, these are the outcome of the units<br>

            1.6 “Web accessibility basically means that people with disabilities can use the Web. More specifically, <br>
            web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact <br>
            with the Web”. “http://uiaccess.com/understanding.html#whatis
            It needs to think and keep enation of any detail to: <br>
            “Some people cannot use their arms or hands<br>
            Some people with tremors and older people with diminishing fine motor control can use a keyboard, but not a mouse.<br>
            Some people cannot see at all and use a screen reader that reads aloud the information in the web page.<br>
            Some people have blurry vision and cannot read text unless it is very large.” <br>
            These points and may  more we have to take them in our account when for design websites<br>
