            <p>
            3.1 the tools were very useful and easy to use. Very efficient for keeping our time save. We did it in Python teams and the website project.  the disadvantage or problem that makes something a less attractive idea synonym disadvantage, for me it was the chair, it is solid to set on it for all this time

            3.2
            laptops charges, suitable chairs (please not solid) any more. Rack and limit how much time we're spending on tasks. Taking regular breaks and the advantage of your commute.

            3.3 next time, be one time, asking the tauter for any question to understand and making everything clear (do not warry), manage your time. Practising at home and during the weekends

            3.4 I do know really, I am not sure, I hate to be testing or taking exams because it is not the right way to know or understand specially with people who had mental health issue
